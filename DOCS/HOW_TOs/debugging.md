## Debugging with Visual Studio Code

- Run the part of the application you are working on like normal e.g. `yarn ui` for storybook or `yarn start` for the app.
- Then open the project in Visual Studio Code select the part of the application from Visual Studio Code debugging menu
- Then ress `F5` or the play button in the debugging menu to start debugging. This will attach the debugger to the running process and you can set breakpoints and inspect variables.
